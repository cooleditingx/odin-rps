## 📖 Description

The **Rock Paper Scissors** project is a core exercise focused on building interactive web applications using pure JavaScript. While it serves to program the classic game logic and handle DOM manipulation, its design is heavily influenced by the visual identity of the global phenomenon, **Squid Game**.

The application pits the user against a randomized computer opponent over a series of rounds. The thematic elements, including custom fonts and simple, geometric visual cues, create a unique and engaging experience distinct from a typical RPS implementation.
